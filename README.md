# Welcome to your Repo...
This Read me file serves the purpose of helping you initialize your repository on your local machine and giving you examples of how to use this repository. It will also serve as a good reference file. To reiterate some things said in class.

1. This Repository is private and can only be viewed by whomever is given permission to view it.
2. Once Final presentations are over I will transfer ownership of the repository to whomever wants it. 
3. I will delete all repositories that are unclaimed on January 1st.
4. Doc will be able to view your repository and might consider your commits as a portion of your grades.

To work with Git I suggest referencing a pluralsight course or youtube video, or checking out this link (it references command line git, but the workflow is still fairly similar) -> http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/

Pluralsight -> https://www.pluralsight.com/

Pluralsight is a website that has video tutorials for technologies that you might find helpful. The tutorials are *really* long usually, but they are done by professionals who know what they are talking about. The service is not free, but there should be a way to get a 3 month free trial. This is a link that shows how, although I am not sure if it is still correct -> https://absolute-sharepoint.com/2015/12/free-pluralsight-6-month-subscription.html

The basics of Git are simple. I will be refering to GIT VERBS in all caps to help keep consistency. In Summary, You will have a local Git repository of code on your machine.

General workflow without branches...
1. PULL changes from the Remote Repo
2. Make changes and test
3. COMMIT changes to your Local Repo
4. PUSH changes to the Remote Repo

When working with branches...
You can CHECKOUT different branches of the repo. When you CHECKOUT a branch you make a copy of it and it becomes a new branch on your local machine. When you make a change to a branch you then have to COMMIT the changes. Then you can MERGE that branch into your copy of the master branch. Then PUSH your copy of master to your remote repository. This remote repository is whats on Github and what your teammates can access. The work flow for branching is as follows:

1. CHECKOUT new branch
2. Make changes and test
3. COMMIT changes to your new branch
4. PUSH changes to the branch in the Remote Repo
*Once branch is ready to merge move to Step 5, otherwise repeat 2-4*
5. MERGE the branch into your Local Copy of master
6. Resolve any merge conflicts
7. COMMIT any changes due to merge conflicts
8. PUSH to the Remote Repository

While I would strongly suggest you DO NOT work on your master branch, you can do everything without having to create new branches and merge them back into the master branch. This is not the best practice. The work flow above is only a suggestion for one way to use GIT. Research GIT and play with it. That is the only way you will learn it. 

Things to research that might help in general...
Bootstrap, Javascript, Frameworks, PHP, HTML5 Canvas, DATABASES & SQL, Backend vs Frontend.

This is just a general list that might help. Most importantly start researching the technologies that you will be using on your project.

Presentation TIPS

1. Dress for success -> Business Casual. NICE Jeans are acceptable.
2. No Gum Chewing.
3. Dont stand infront of projector.
4. Never show code, never show database.
5. Have someone take notes from peoples suggestions.
6. At beginning of presentation have everyone introduce themselves.
7. If your project breaks keep calm and keep the presentation moving.
8. Have your best communicator drive the presentation.
9. No hats!

As always, we are here to help, so feel free to ask us questions.  And remember, Fayard 125 is the Computer Science Majors Lab, and it's where most of the upperclassmen hang out, aka it's where more than likely there is someone who would be willing to help you out if we can't.
